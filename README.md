# Project-4-R-

In this project I did an exploratory data analysis based on UK respondents. The goal was to explore what the most common ages, salaries and race were. The conclusion was most respondents living in the UK were between 25-44 years old, earned well above UK median salary and were mostly white.

The graphs from the R programming is in "graphs project 1" word file. The R programming is in "Project 1 R" file.
